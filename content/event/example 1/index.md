More Details:
- **Rural Delicious 2** The studio takes "Looking for the Cowherd from Lanzhou University" as the theme, shoots a series of short videos and posts them on new media platforms, providing Lanzhou students with a platform to showcase themselves.
- **Achieve** We have produced a total of 9 videos, obtained the school level innovation and entrepreneurship qualification, and successfully completed the project.
- **Detailed responsibilities** From early video planning, mid stage filming, post editing, and full participation, I have effectively honed my professional skills.
